JSON, a way to present an object - or strengthify an object, object is a multi dimensional object, like a desk for example.
It is hard to save a multidimensional object, so we break it into pieces and package it to carry it elsewhere.
Very long thing string, string-ify. Once you make a string you can transmit.

JSON.stringify = make an object to a string
JSON.stringify(object)
Why to stringify? To store and transmit the object.

After you stringify you break down the multi dimension object to a string.
Afterwards from the stringify, you have to transmit back and reconstruct the object.

JSON.parse(string) = reconstruct the object. Break down 3D object to string with stringify, reconstruct it with parse.

localStorage[key] = string; >>> accessed by key, key is a file name for example. Vulnerable if you clear browsing data.
localStorage[key] = zip(string); parse the zipped string to return to original object.

string.indexOf('target')
(-1 not found)

str.substring(starting, endposition);
s = 'abc'
s.substring(0,2): ab

str.replace(/reg/ig, "dfd");
